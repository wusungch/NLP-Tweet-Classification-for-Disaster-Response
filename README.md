# NLP-Tweet-Classification-for-Disaster-Response
This project aims to classify tweets into disaster and non-disaster categories. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle's "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition, the goal is to predict whether a tweet relates to a real disaster or not. This classification has significant implications for emergency response and news reporting.
